🗺️ Capstone Project: Geocoding Osmania University
This project demonstrates how to retrieve and visualize geographic data using Python and OpenStreetMap. 
It was developed as part of the Python for Everybody specialization by Dr. Charles Severance
(Dr. Chuck), specifically building on the geocoding module in Course 4.
While the core files (where.js, where.html) were provided by Dr. Chuck, the location choice (Osmania University)
and execution were independently developed and personalized.

🔧 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python 3 (executed via command prompt)
- urllib, json, ssl
- OpenStreetMap
- where.js and where.html (course-provided visualization tools)

📍 Project Overview
- Input: "Osmania University"
- Output: Latitude/Longitude retrieved and plotted on OpenStreetMap
- Execution: Python script run via command prompt, followed by HTML/JS visualization

💡 Why This Project Matters
This capstone reflects the integration of multiple Python skills—data retrieval, parsing, and 
visualization—into a cohesive, real-world application. It closely follows the course structure while 
demonstrating independent execution and contextual adaptation. It’s a strong example of applying course
knowledge to a personalized use case.
