- Variables, loops, conditionals
- Honors tasks with extended logic

### 2. Python Data Structures
- Lists, dictionaries, tuples
- Honors-level parsing and data manipulation

### 3. Accessing Web Data
- Regular expressions, web scraping
- XML, JSON, and API handling

### 4. Using Databases with Python
